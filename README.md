# Supercharging Android apps with machine learning  (TensorFlow Library)

In this repo I'm gonna apply Machine learning on Android. There are two approaches to apply machine learning in Mobile Apps:

- First, a more practical way is applying a large deep learning model by deploying a pre-trained model within within the App or deploy and train it on the server and just request and parse results through the Mobile App via APIs.

- The other approach is to get instant data and train the model on your device directly. But only simple models can be applied without large GPU computation, otherwise it will result a bad user experience.

I'm following the 1st one by playing around [TensorFlow Library](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
